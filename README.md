 Our project is a climbing game, inspired by Valley Peaks and Firewatch. Step into the role of a brave park ranger on a mission to save your stranded friend, Randy, as a violent storm brews over the mountains. Navigate treacherous cliffs, unstable rocks, and intensifying weather conditions using unique climbing mechanics, including a web-shooting ability, while uncovering the story through dynamic comic-book-style cutscenes and dialogue.

You'll face challenges that test your skill, strategy, and reflexes—like shaky rocks and limited hang-time—all while racing against time to rescue Randy. With each climb, the storm worsens, the music builds tension, and the stakes get higher. Will you overcome the mountain’s wrath and save your friend?
